# Wordle

## Goal
Recreate Wordle in Unity

## Summary
Play the game on [itch.io](https://steamedbunsstudios.itch.io/wordle-ripoff)!

The game was made as a passion project to test my skills in UI creation based on a given design.
Time taken: ~2.5 hours

Created loosely based on a [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/Tbcgqz5lM38?si=SZZVWtgDyosG6Xmi)
